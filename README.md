Hex math:
equilateral (0 degree projection):
"height" = L√3
"wide width" = L
"narrow width" = L√3
narrow side length = L


45 degree projection:
"height" = L
"wide width" = L
"narrow width" = 2 * √(3/8)L
narrow side length = √(2)L


60 degree projection:
"height" = (3/2)L
"wide width" = L
"narrow width" = 2 * √(3/4)L
narrow side length = √(13/16)L
